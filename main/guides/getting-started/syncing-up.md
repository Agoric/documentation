# Syncing Up on Mainnet

Tune in to [Network Upgrades Governance](https://community.agoric.com/c/governance/network-upgrades/15) in the [Agoric Community Forum](https://community.agoric.com/) for upcoming changes to mainnet node operations, including deployment of
new [agoric-sdk software releases](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/releases).

Mainnet operation is supported on a peer-to-peer basis.
[Validator profiles](https://community.agoric.com/c/validators/validator-profiles/24)
highlight relevant community contributions. For example, guides
for state-sync server setup are available from
[polkachu](https://github.com/Agoric/validator-profiles/tree/main/polkachu.com) and
[kjnodes](https://community.agoric.com/t/validator-profile-kjnodes/314).
