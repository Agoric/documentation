# SubQuery Indexing

This document explains how to index Agoric blockchain data with SubQuery's open source data indexer.

## Overview

SubQuery is a leading blockchain data indexer that provides developers with fast, flexible, universal, open source and decentralised APIs for web3 projects. SubQuery SDK allows developers to get rich indexed data and build intuitive and immersive decentralised applications in a faster and more efficient way. SubQuery supports 100+ ecosystems including Agoric Cosmos, Ethereum, Polygon, Polkadot, Algorand, NEAR, and Avalanche.

Features include multiple RPC endpoint configurations, multi-worker capabilities and a configurable caching architecture. To find out more, visit our [documentation](https://academy.subquery.network/).

## Getting started
Take a look at this [SubQuery Starter Project](https://github.com/subquery/cosmos-subql-starter/tree/main/Agoric/agoric-starter) that introduces SubQuery's Agoric support by indexing all transfer events and messages on the Agoric network.

You can also follow along this [step by step guide](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart_chains/cosmos-agoric.html) to get familiar with SubQuery or check out the [Agoric x SubQuery workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC5wQOcWynU) to see an actual demo.

## Running and Hosting your Agoric SubQuery APIs

SubQuery is [open-source](https://opensource.org/osd/), licensed under the [GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE](https://github.com/subquery/subql/blob/main/LICENSE), meaning you have the freedom to run it in the following three ways:

* Locally on your own computer, or a cloud provider of your choosing. View the [instructions on how to run SubQuery locally](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/run.html).

* You can publish it to SubQuery's [Managed Service](https://managedservice.subquery.network/login), where SubQuery will host projects on your behalf. There is also a free tier. [Find out how](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/publish.html).

* You can publish it to the[decentralised SubQuery Network](https://kepler.subquery.network/dashboard). The SubQuery Network indexes and services data to the global community in an incentivised and verifiable way and supports Agoric from launch.
