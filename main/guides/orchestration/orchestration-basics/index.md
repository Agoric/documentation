# dApp Orchestration Basics

To get started with developing using the Orchestration API, developers can make use of our [dapp-orchestration-basics](https://github.com/Agoric/dapp-orchestration-basics) template.

Following the dApp pattern of our existing dapp templates, `dapp-orchestration-basics` also contains a `contract` and a `ui`
directory within a single yarn workspace. In this walkthrough, we learn about the installation process, the contract
code, and UI components of `dapp-orchestration-basics`.
