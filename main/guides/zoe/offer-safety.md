# Offer Safety

<Zoe-Version/>

**Definition**: *Offer safety* means that the user is guaranteed to either
get what they wanted or get back a full refund of what they offered.

For Zoe to enforce offer safety, the user must
give Zoe a `proposal`. This is a description of both what they want and what
they are offering, and when and how the user can exit the contract. Zoe uses
this last to enforce payout liveness. The exit specification is optional, and
defaults to `OnDemand`, meaning a user can exit the contract instance at their
discretion. 

For example, I want to buy an event ticket for which I offer $100. In Zoe, 
my `proposal` is:

```js
{
  give: { Price: dollars100 },
  want: { Asset: ticket1 },
}
```
`Asset` and `Price` are the `keywords` of a contract. Keywords
let contract users easily and consistently refer to parts of
a proposal, payments escrowed with Zoe, and payouts received from Zoe.

For example, the user escrows assets with Zoe by submitting payments
using keywords. In this example, I would send Zoe a $100 payment to
escrow my offer, as Zoe immediately escrows the `give:`-specified payment.

After the user escrows, they get a promise for a payout from Zoe.
This is the payout that offer safety is enforced over. The payout *must*
be either what the user wanted (an event ticket in the above example)
or a full refund of what they escrowed ($100 in this example).

We can enforce offer safety because Zoe controls the payout. In the example, 
if I try to buy my event ticket using a smart contract on Zoe, the contract
can tell Zoe to update its bookkeeping to say I've bought a ticket.
But, Zoe only actually updates its records and gives me an event ticket
payout if that update is offer-safe and conserves total supply.

The offer safety enforcement code is in
[offerSafety.js](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/HEAD/packages/zoe/src/contractFacet/offerSafety.js).
Tests, including edge cases, are in [test-offerSafety.js](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/HEAD/packages/zoe/test/unitTests/test-offerSafety.js).

## Implementation Questions

**Under offer safety, can I get a full refund *and* what I wanted?**

Yes, you can get a full refund *and* what you wanted. Offer safety guarantees at least 
one is true. Both could also be true.

**What if there are no rules under `give`?**

If there are no rules or if `give` is omitted, then you get a full refund
of what you put in, fulfilling offer safety. It's just the case that
you put in nothing, so you get back nothing. However, you *might* also 
get what you wanted, depending on whether your offer of
nothing for it is accepted.

**What if there are no rules under `want`**

If there are no rules or `want` is omitted, then you get what
you wanted, in this case nothing. This fulfills offer safety.
