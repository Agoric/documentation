# What is Agoric?

Agoric is a Cosmos-based Layer 1 blockchain for building cross-chain
smart contracts in JavaScript. The platform’s asynchronous,
multi-block architecture uniquely enables developers to orchestrate
liquidity and services across the growing multi-chain universe, making
Agoric ideal for building software with seamless user experiences. The
native token BLD is used for staking and governance. The
over-collateralized IST stable token is used to pay network fees.

The Agoric blockchain is built on the CometBFT consensus system with
native Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) support. Smart
contracts can seamlessly integrate 3rd party libraries, so a contract
could invoke an operation on Avalanche via Axelar’s GMP the same way
it does on Osmosis via IBC. Agoric smart contracts are long-lived
processes that can execute across multiple blocks by default, so it’s
easy to design contract logic that makes a request over IBC to another
chain, awaits the result, then reacts to it. With on-chain timers,
developers can program Agoric smart contracts to take actions across
time with scheduled, long-term, and periodic actions
(e.g. subscriptions, mortgages).

Agoric’s hardened JavaScript makes blockchain programming accessible
to the 17+ million JavaScript developers around the world. Hardened
JavaScript provides the safe, stable environment that developers need
to build, deploy, and operate sophisticated applications, NFTs, and
DeFi markets. Beyond the JavaScript programming language, the Agoric
platform introduces Zoe, a “first of its kind” escrow service that
enables safe economic composition between smart contracts. Zoe brings
to web3 developers on the Agoric platform the kind of modern,
pluggable component framework that has dominated web2 development, the
same kind of exponential composability that led to the explosive
growth of the Node.js, React.js, and other JavaScript ecosystems.
